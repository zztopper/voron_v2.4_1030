#[filament_switch_sensor runout]
##   When set to True, a PAUSE will execute immediately after a runout
##   is detected. Note that if pause_on_runout is False and the
##   runout_gcode is omitted then runout detection is disabled. Default
##   is True.

##   The minimum amount of time in seconds to delay between events.

##   The amount of time to delay, in seconds, between the pause command

##   Default is 0.5 seconds.
